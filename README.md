# 🚀 Toy App — Ruby on Rails

A **lightweight Toy Application built with Ruby on Rails** to explore the fundamentals of Rails development, RESTful design, and MVC architecture.  
This project follows the philosophy of the *Ruby on Rails Tutorial* and is meant purely for **learning and experimentation**.

---

## ✨ What is This App?

The **Toy App** is a simple, Twitter-style Rails application that allows:
- Creating **Users**
- Posting **Microposts**
- Understanding how resources interact in Rails

> ⚠️ This app is intentionally minimal. The focus is on **learning Rails concepts**, not building a production-ready product.

---

## 🧠 Why This Project?

Rails scaffolding is powerful but can feel like magic.  
This project helps you:
- See Rails in action quickly
- Understand **URLs, controllers, models, and views**
- Learn **RESTful routing** and database associations
- Prepare for building full-scale Rails apps from scratch
